Treasure

Earthly treasures
The worthlessness of it all
Fueled by hubris
Men keep hunting 
They keep digging for more
Little pockets become canyons
Deep gorges in our hearts that want to be filled
And so we are left thirsting 
Craving for more
But going for satisfaction inn mundane things


Anchored by Your love
Let me grow deep roots
Let me bear great fruits
