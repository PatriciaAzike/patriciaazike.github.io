Aye, friend, you haven't missed your steps, nor have you stumbled onto a Latin site by mistake. My love for Latin, rooted in childhood memories of attending the Latin Mass, has always been a guiding force in my creative journey.

I have always loved writing. It’s the one space where I can express myself freely without holding back. Life has taken me through twists and turns to arrive here—at the point where writing is no longer just a pastime but an avenue to educate and share hope. I’m fully embracing this chapter of my life.

One day, I stumbled upon the phrase ‘Per aspera ad astra—through hardship to the stars.’ It captivated me because I was all too familiar with the hardship part—not necessarily in the way you might think. It’s that longing for transformation, that deep yearning to reshape your surroundings, only to realize you can’t do it alone. But I wasn’t going to let that stop me from reaching for the stars.

The Latin phrases on this site also draw inspiration from the mottos of Oregon and Idaho. Oregon’s motto speaks directly to me. It speaks about resilience–rising through difficulty and soaring. Idaho holds the unique distinction of being the only state with a seal designed by a woman (pardon my bias).

My name is Patricia, and I share my journey here in the hope that it inspires yours.
